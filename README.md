# Components Options and API Compositions

## First steps.
- Start a vue projects with vite.
```sh
npm init vite
```
- Then 
```sh
cd "folder name (same name of project)"
npm install
```
- From now .....
```sh
npm run dev
```
- Something to see is also the command
```sh
vue ui
```
- This is a manager with ui for vue project

## Async Components
- In App.vue will create a const "HelloWorld" using defineAsyncComponent. This will charge in an async way this component. So will first charge the page and then will charge the component.
- I left commented the line 2 where the components is imported directly. (just to see the difference)














# Vue 3 + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
